\section{c++}
C++は1983年にBjarne StroustrupによってC言語の拡張として開発された．
その後幾度かの改訂を経て1998年に最初の標準が制定された(C++98)．

C++はC言語のようにハードに近いシステムを作ることはもちろん，
近年ではGUIアプリケーション，ゲーム，サーバなど様々な場面で使用されている．
また，言語の特徴と普及率から最近はやりの競技プログラミングでもC++が使われることが多い．

\subsection{バージョン}
C++は絶えず規格の改訂を行っている．
代表的な規格(バージョン)として以下のものがある．
\begin{itemize}
    \item C++03
    \item C++11(C++0x)
    \item C++14(C++1y)
    \item C++17(C++1z)
\end{itemize}

C++講座ではC++03(と一部C++11)を扱うものとしてオブジェクト指向を学んでいた．
しかし，C++03はあくまでC言語+オブジェクト指向+STLといった具合で，
便利なC言語と言えてしまう．
おそらくC++らしいC++と言えるのは大幅な改訂が行われたC++11からである．
故に本講座では便利なC言語と呼べるC＋＋03から脱却し，
最低限C++11を書けるように様々な知識を得ていく．

なお，以下C++とはC++11以降を指すものとする．

\subsection{C言語との差}
C++はオブジェクト指向というC言語にはない強みがある．
これだけ聞くとC++は純粋なオブジェクト指向言語と勘違いしてしまうがそうではない．
C++は手続き型，オブジェクト指向，ジェネリック，関数型
といった様々なプログラミングパラダイムを組み合わせたマルチパラダイム言語なのである．
手続き型のみのC言語よりこの点が非常に強力である．
各パラダイムの説明は本講座では省略するので各自調べてみるのが良いだろう．

また，C++にはStandard Template Library(STL)と呼ばれる標準ライブラリが存在する．
STLはジェネリック機能を用いており，コンテナ，イテレータ，アルゴリズム，関数オブジェクトという要素から成り立っている．
これらはパラダイムとは違いC++のために設計されたものである．
故に，STLを上手く使って行くことがC++erになるための最初の一歩であろう．

\subsection{本講座で扱う内容}
本講座で扱い内容については具体的内容は定めていない．

最低限としては以下のことを考えている．
\begin{itemize}
    \item STLコンテナ
    \item 値の種類
    \item カプセル化のための手法
    \item 最新C++の便利機能
\end{itemize}
